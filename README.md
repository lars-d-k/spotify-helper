# spotify-helper

## Installation
To install a local dev version of my spotify helper, follow these steps:
- Clone this repo to a local folder: `git clone <url> <dir>`
- Add a client id: `script.ts` > `const clientId = "<client_id>"`
  - Create an app [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Run the vite script: `npm run dev`

## Todo
I still have some goals in mind for this spotify helper:
- prio
  - Automatically save to playlist
    - requires advanced authentication
  - improving ui
    - css library
    - improve layout
    - naviation through functionalitues ?
- tedious
  - export app as downloadable or runnable
  - host app using pages
